# Success is my only option 

## What I learned so far today 

* I learned what and where Github came from and started from
* Talked about ACP 
* I learned how to link my pages together 
* Learned what a DVCS (Distributed Version Control systems)
  * Allows collaborations and makes it difficult for work to be loss in case of server failure 
* Practiced Cloning repositories so that we can focus on using the terminal instead of the website 


## Future Goals for my pages 
1. Try and create or edit a nicer looking webpage 
1. Add images and make it more unique to me
1. Get better at terminal and understand how it works at a deeper level 
    * such as figuring out CD and LS
    * Understanding how to clone and getting better at it. 
    * Furthering my knowledge on what Github offers 
4. I am excited for HTML and CSS as well as other languages that come with this environment
