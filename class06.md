#Class 6 
## What a day 
### Java Script 

# Part one of two 
### Video Notes 
* Never thought about how computers work before

## What Makes a computer a computer? 
### Computers a tool
1. Input 
1. Storage
1. Processing 
1. Output 

Computers were made out of wood and metal (I never knew that, I always just assumed it was made of plastic or metal)

## Input
* What *you* do or what someone else does.
* This can be by
	* a controller 
	* a keypad
	* Touch Screen 
	* sound
	* Camera

## Storage - Processing
* Goes to the memory and goes through processing, repeats until it was ready for output 

## Output 
* Depends on what the computer is designed to do 


## Binary & Data 
* bit is the smallest amount of data 
* Binary Number system
	* 0 and 1 only 
	* Decimal number 0-9
	* Any number can be represented by 0 and 1 (That's crazy)
* Everything can be represented by numbers
## Pixels are colors and each color can represented by numbers

## Circuits 
Takes a signal and gives another one back 
Not, And, Adder 
Circuits are lots of small calculations 
Small circuits are faster because they have less to travel 

## CPU, Memory, Input and Output
As I type this, the computer I am using is doing thousands of instructions
The larger or greater the work the more cpu's and memory you will need

## Hardware vs Software
Hardwar	
	* Is the physical aspect of the computer
		* the case, the hardrive, the key board
Software 
	* Everything that actually makes the computer run.
