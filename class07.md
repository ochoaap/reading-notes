# Class 07 

Today in my reading we went over a new process called a Function 

*Basically* a function tidy's up the code and you are able to place everything into one simple word that I can easily place lower down and even repeat if necessary without having the retype the entire code. 

This allows the coding to be readable as well as easy to understand. 

### Functions should have a note stating what it is doing. 
Though there can be "anonymous" functions without this. Though, I can't imagine why you would ever do that. 

### THINK LIKE A COMPUTER 

This was probably my favorite part of the reading as well as the watching the other classmates (who I am not in a class with) Attempt to put on a hoodie by following the exact instructions. 

Computers do every task as if it were the first time and go through very specific steps. It makes me understand how they work and what *I* need to do or what messages I need to convey.
