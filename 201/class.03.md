# Reading Assignment 3


## Lists 
* I am going to use the list function to talk about lists
* There are ordered and unordered lists. I am currently using an unordered list.
* There are also definitiion lists
* Nested lists 
	* Such as this! 

## Boxes 
Box dimiensions is by default large enough to hold the contents
However if you have too much information for that box you can use the
overflow property - this tells the browswer what to do if you run out of 
room in your box. 

### Padding, margin, and border 
YOu can use these to make
1. Borders 
2. To create distance or position text and or an image 
3. For my second lab I used margins to move the photo slightly away from 
my text. 

## Arrays
They are useful for a lists or set of variables that are related to each other
They help out when you don't know how many items there are
*IE a shopping list at say Amazon. 

## If Else 
A simple example of this is:
If the score is about 90% they pass anything **else** is a failure. 

## Loops
* For - runs code a specific amount of times
* While - will continue as long as the condition is true
* Do While - it will always run at least once even if the condition is false

Loops are great for running an **array** of codes.
