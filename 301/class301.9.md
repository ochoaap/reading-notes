### Concept of Functional Programming in Javascript. 

*“Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify."* — **John Outerhout**

## Pure Functions
* It returns the same result if given teh same arugements. 
* It does not cause any observable side-effects

## Benefits of Pure Functions 
1. Easier to Twest
1. Don't need to mock anything
1. Use different contexts. 

## Immutability 
- Unable to be changed or unchanging
- You create a **New** Object


### Functions as First Class Entities
1. Refer to it from constants and variables
1. Pass it as a parameter
1. Return it as a result from other functions. 

## Filter
* Expects true or false
