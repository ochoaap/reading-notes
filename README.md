# My name is Anthony and this is my Reading Notes page! 
### Day two of Class 

 Today we set up our computers with Terminal and Unbuntu. 
 I typed "code" in my terminal and it opened up Visual Studio, it was the first time I have ever used my terminal to open something 
 The process was a little tricky one of the biggest issues I had was that I had to go through my BIOS system and turn on my visual hyperlink, took a lot of time and Google to get 
 this done. Overall, I felt very accomplished knowing that I found the problem and solved without any help from the teachers or TA's
