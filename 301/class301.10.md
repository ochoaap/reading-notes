## Javascript Call Stack 
**A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.**

* Call stacks can only do one thing at a time
* Execution is Synchronous
* Function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies temporary memory
* LIFO
  * Last
  * In
  * First
  * Out
## STack Over Flow
Happens when a Function calls itself without an exit point.
