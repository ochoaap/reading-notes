* > greater than

( there seems to be a lot of little signs that I will have to learn) 


## Loops! 
Loops check to see if something returns back as true. If it is true a block of code will run. Then the condition will be check again and it checks out again, the cod will run again until the condition returns flase 

Types of loops
1. for
1. while
1. do while 

## Loop counters 
1. Initialization 
1. Condition
1. Update 

Loops seem simple enough to understand, it is a great way to ensure everything is running the way it is supposed to. Having the ability to change how or when it stops is greatly appreciated as well
