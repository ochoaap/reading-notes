# Mark up
There are a lot of markup tags (for example the "#" is the one I am using above. However below are a few tags that are commonly used in HTML 
* <h1></h1> = These are headings and you should only have one of each. So, one h1 and then the next would h2 and so on. 
* <p> = Paragraph, simple enough, this is where you would write a paragraph. 
* **<b>** = is bold. 
* *<i> = is italics. See what I did there?
* Superscript and Subscript are a little more tricky to explain. Superscript is mainly for mathematical, dates, and suffixes. While Subscripts 
are what make teh the "2" in H2O smaller in a word document. 
* "<s>" was interesting to me as it is something that is no longer valid or relevant, but shouldjn't be deleted either. I am curoious as to 
what situation would call for that. 

# CSS 
## CSS is what makes everything pretty or cool! 
1. <style> exactly what it looks like. Styling the text, or the <body>. 
2. Links are awesome and CSS makes it so you can just click "here" instead of seeing a very long unappealing url. 
## CSS Selector
A selector is what selects parts or elements of HTML to add CSS below are couple examples. 
* universal selector (applies to all elements)
* Type ( for specific or whatever matches) 

# Java Script 
Script are basically instructions that the computer or browswer follows in order. Each set of instructiosn is called a **statement**.
Javascript also opens up alerts and prompts that can bring up questions or notify you of something. I believe a facebook messenge on your 
phone popping up would fall under an alert. 
## Comments
They should be written to explain what your code does. It aids in the ability to read and understand for someone else who may come upon it. 
## Variables. 
Naming a variable helps make the code easier to run, but also allows you to use the same function, alert, prompt multple times without having to 
retype it everytime. 
## Operators 
Allow programmers to create a value from multiple values
### Types of Operators. 
1. Assignment 
2. Arithmetic 
3. String  

# Decisions and Loops 
Two parts of a decions
1. Expression is evaluated, and returns a value
1. A coditional statement says what to do in a particular situation. 
For example. If someone passes a test (let's say 70%) they can move on, but if they *don't* get a 70% then they are not able to pass. 
This would be a decision - the value is the test score while the coditional statement would tell the broswer or computer that as long as
certain parameters are met then one of two things happen. 

# Commit Messages 
They are important because they tell either the User or someone else who may be working the user what it is. A commit message can be small
and should state **What** was done. Be concise and consistent
