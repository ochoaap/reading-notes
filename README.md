# What is a growth mindset?
### A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

# WHAT DOES GROWTH MINDSET MEAN TO *ME?*
### In simple terms, a growth mindset to me is the mindset that enables and motivates growth and change in a person 
### The idea or mentality that we as people are always learning and should always be striving to be better.
