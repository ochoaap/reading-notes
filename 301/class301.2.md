## What is JQUERY?

"jQuery is JavaScript that you include in your web page that lets you find elements using CSS-Style Selectors"

### Why use jQuery?
1. Simple Secletors 
  * Older Browsers do not support the newest methods.
  * jQuery uses CSS type selectors that allows older browers to keep up with the changes without having to change everying or learn a new method. 
  * Requires Less code 
  * More accurate when selecting. 
2. Common Tasks in less Code
  * Loop through elements
  * Add/Remove Elements
  * Fade Elements into/out of view
  * Handle Ajax requests. 
3. jQuery makes it easier to hand events since it traves the DOM faster. 


  ## Where to include your jQuery 
  You can load it from a CDN (*Content Delivery Network*). A CDN is a series of servers spread out around teh world and are designed to serve static files. If it is loading from a CDN you will syntax similar to below 
  ``` 
  <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
```
### Placing the script tag at the bottom of the body tag will allow the page to render without having to stop loading the rest. Since- once the browser starts loading any type of JS it pauses all other downloads.
