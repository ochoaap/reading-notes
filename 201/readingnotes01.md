# Reading Assignment 

## Overview of Reading 
### structure 
  Structure seems to be incredibly important when it comes to code. Especially, with html and the openign and closing brackets, as well as where certain parts start and end. *for example* during 102, I was confusing header and head, and it was not doing what I needed it to do. Such a simple mistake or misunderstanding of what it is can change the entirety of the site you're attempting to create. 

### extra markup 
* Elements are something I want to learn more about and understand
* The way the html is formatted seems to be something that will be challenging (Trying to remember what it is and where it goes)
* I already wrote about layout in structure, but again this will be all about attention to small details. 

### Layout and Html
What type of document are you creating. A DOCTYPE will tell the browswer what it should be reading.
