# Day 5 of Coding 
## What I learned about CSS and Color 
* There are 147 pre-defined color names 
* There are RGB values that can be changed by putting in the value 
* Typically the background is white - but you can place a color or make it white
* Hex Codes show values that represent Red Green and Blue in a Hexidecimal code

### All colors on a computer screen are a mixture of Red, Green, and Blue (RGB)

## Contrast and Opacity 
We want to make sure that there is enough contrast between the colors so that it is readable. FOr example Black background with white lettering would be high contrast vs white on offwhite would be very low
Opacity is how much something is transparent or not. the value is 0.0 - 1.0. 

## HSL Colors 
* Hue
   * often represented by a color wheel
* Saturation 
   * Is the amount of gray in a color (I never knew that!) 
* Lightness 
   * The amount of white or black in a color. 

# I am very interested and excited to work with CSS!
