# My name is Anthony and this is my Reading Notes page! 
## Disclaimer 
I came from a different class where everything was done in a different order. I am not making this my main page as well as my second day page. 

### Day two of Class 

 Today we set up our computers with Terminal and Unbuntu. 
 I typed "code" in my terminal and it opened up Visual Studio, it was the first time I have ever used my terminal to open something 
 The process was a little tricky one of the biggest issues I had was that I had to go through my BIOS system and turn on my visual hyperlink, took a lot of time and Google to get 
 this done. Overall, I felt very accomplished knowing that I found the problem and solved without any help from the teachers or TA's

### A growth mindset believes that oneâ€™s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points. A growth mindset is synonymous with a love of learning.By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.

# WHAT DOES GROWTH MINDSET MEAN TO *ME?*
### In simple terms, a growth mindset to me is the mindset that enables and motivates growth and change in a person 
### The idea or mentality that we as people are always learning and should always be striving to be better.
