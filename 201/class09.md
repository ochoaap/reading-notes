# Class 09 Reading Notes. 

## Forms 

You use forms to collect information from visitors to your site. 
The information of the form is sent in name/value pairs 
Each form has a name, and the text or values entered are sent to the server 


## List, Tables, and Forms oh my! 

* List markers can be given different appearances using the list style type or list style image properties 
* Table cells have different borders and spacing in different web browsers. 
* Forms are easier to use if the form is vertically aligned in CSS 
* Forms come across better the more interactive they are. 

## Events 
1. Events indicate when something happens in the browser
1. The process of Binding is telling which even you are waiting to happen. 
1. When an event occurs on an elment it can trigger a JS function, 
    * when this happens - it can change the browswer making it feel more interactive/immersive. 
1. You can delegat events to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.
