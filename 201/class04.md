## Links
> Many people navigate websites by scanning for the text for links. 
Links are very important in a website, and almost everything that's clickable
is a type of link it seems. 
==Absolute URL's vs Relative URL's==
Absloute URL's are what you would type into a browser, ie Facebook.com, you 
could add facebook.com/anthonyochoa and get my facebook page (theoretically, as
this is not my actual URL). Where as Relative URL, would be like clicking on 
somone's page in facebook and going to their page, you are keeping the same
Domain name, while changing the path. 

# Layout 
* CSS and HTML use boxes to create the layout of the page. 
* Each Box can be a Block level or Inline Box
	* Block Level start a new line
	* Inline boxes wrap or move around surrounding text. 
* If a box is inside another box. 
	* the Outer box is the **Parent** box or containing element
* You can create divs to group the elements/boxes together
## Controlling the Elements 
1. Normal Flow 
	a. Every block level appears on a new line. 
	b. causing the item to appear lower. 
2. Relative 
	a. Moves it from normal flow to where it should have been placed.
3. Absolute. 
	a. Taken out of normal flow and positions it to its containing element
4. Fixed 
	a. a form of absolute
	b. positions in relation to the broswer window
5. Floating
	a. Allows you to take the element out and position it far left or right of containing box. 

# Functions
> Allow you to group a series of statements together to perform a specific task
Declaring a function requires that you name it, and then have statements that 
follow through a specific task. 
Calling a function is the act of actually *using* the declared function 
### Functions that need information 
Sometimes you have to give information or information has to be recieved to 
declare or call that specific function 

# Pair Programming
