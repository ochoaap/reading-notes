## SQL 
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 
* It is a language designed to:
  * Allow both technical and Non technical users
    * Query 
    * Manipulate
    * Transform Data from a relational Database. 

Since it is so simple to use it allows storage for millions of users. 

## Select Statements 
Select Statements are also known as **queries**

```
SELECT * FROM 

```

## SQL uses a simple command to locate through a massive database. 
There are different commands such as where, where you can determine where the program looks or doesnt look depending on what the situation is. 
Since some databases can have well over 1 million entries this allows a much more efficient way of going through it instead of trying to read and dicipher every entry.
