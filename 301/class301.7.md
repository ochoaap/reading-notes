## Conversation with Brother
The conversation with the brother helped iiulstrate that when we use our broswers to look something up, it is almost like a conversation. The URL being a noun, while "getting" something is the verb. That Roy saw it this way, while most of us only see it as it 'just happening' or some kind of werid mechincal magic. 

I think that because the information was conveyed in a conversation style writing, was meant to show that our computer, in a way, is having a conversation with the internet everytime we use it. I think that is important and helps out a lot with the understanding of how browers, urls, and http work.
