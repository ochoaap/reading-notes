# Class 5

## Node

### Heroku
I went through all of the steps and have deployed a temporary site. 

``` 
https://pacific-dusk-59048.herokuapp.com/
```

### What the site shows

The site basically just shows how it works
1. the app was deployed to Heroku by Git
1. Heroku received the source code, fetched all of the dependencies in the jSon file. 
1. The platform spins up a dyno, a lightweight container that provides isolated environments in which the slug can be mounted and executed...(That's weird)
1. THe app can be scaled. 

It shows the next steps, that I am sure we will either do in class or at later time. It has help links. 

The process was pretty straight forward and I am interested in what it does and using it. 

## Skimming

Upon first glance we have a huge block of code that helps push a simple blog to the interweb 
It goes over turning it from local to World Wide or **WWW**
