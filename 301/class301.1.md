## Responsive Wed Design. 

The biggest take away that I can think of is that there are more cellphones that people. I'm not sure why I am a surprised by this, just that I am. Another thing that surprised me right off the bat was that people still use desktops, and still at a greater number than mobile devices. Except for this class and my writing, I never use my laptop. 

### RWD explained
* target รท context = result
  * This is essentially an equation allows the app to create the user interface that will fit the screen that it is on.

### Responsive vs Adaptive vs Mobile 
* Adaptive Web Design (AWD)
  * Is meant to be easily changed or modified for a new purpose 
* Responsive Web Design 
  * It continually updates and changes based on different factors
* Mobile
  * is used for mobile only websites
  * This code is typically "lighter" but comes with some issues and relies on newer code. 


### Veiwport Lengths
1. Veiwports Width (vw)
1. Veiwports Height (vh)
1. Veiwports Min (vmin)
1. Veiwports Max (vmax)

## Mobile First 
It approaches using styles target at smaller veiwports (mobile) as the default instead of using a more generic style point typically used for a desktop. 
Thoughts behind the idea
1. Mobile Users shouldn't have to upload all of the data. 
1. It is a waste of Bandwidth for the user to do so. 
1. Advocates designing with the constraints of a mobile user. 



# Float 

## What is Floating
1. it is in CSS
1. It's a positiong property
1. Also known as Text Wrap
1. Stays within the flow of the webpage.

## Types of floats
1. Left
1. Right
1. None (default)
1. Inherit (Will assume the float value from the elements parent element)

## Floats can be used to create Web Layouts


### Clearing Floats 
Clear has four valid values just like Float does
1. Left
1. Right
1. None
1. Both
1. Bonus would be Inherit, but it does not work on Internet Exploer

### Alternatives
